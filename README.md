# Chicken-Coop-Door-Porta-Galinheiro
Automated system to manage the door and feeder of a chicken coop using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system operates in automatic or manual mode, guided by real-time meteorological data obtained via APIs.
<TODO>
To improve the accuracy of the RTC, it would be better to use a GPS module to set the time during setup, in case of an internet failure.
